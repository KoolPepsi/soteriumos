# Warning: SoteriumOS is currently a work in progress
SoteriumOS is a highly experimental project; we currently do not provide builds and the majority of development goals have not been fully implemented.

# SoteriumOS

SoteriumOS is a ChromiumOS-based distribution focused on being privacy-friendly to all users by removing all unnecessary network requests, removing all forms of telemetry or analytics, and making the operating system functional and usable without Google binaries (i.e. no Google account); without sacrificing the security model of ChromiumOS.
